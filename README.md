# Rationale of this repository

A companion repository to the dataset on https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/robertolofaro/borsa-italiana-listino-as-of-20221119

Rationale: [as described on Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/robertolofaro_roberto-lofaro-datasets-expert-activity-7315613297339260928-LBxw?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAAAUT8sBHrqxYdQXQm0hH6hcF5fnJ-Z7AMg) on 2025-04-09:

As you probably know, in 2022 started the data collection phase of a data project to assess the impact of COVID on Annual Reports of companies listed on the Italian Stock Exchange, Borsa Italiana

I used only public data, and, by applying some criteria about data availability, documentation of the rationale represented by data, ecc (you can read [on my Kaggle curated dataset list](https://kaggle.com/robertolofaro)), moved from over 500 to slightly more than 100.

I still have to assess when I will have time to actually write down the analysis- so, for the time being, focused on thinking the KPIs to make data comparable, and which data should share online, just in case I will not have time to complete as soon as I expected the book associated with that dataset

meanwhile, as I shared in Italian with some colleagues and friends, I think that few months down the road would be interesting to see the evolution of shares portfolios pre-Trade Tariffs and during these phases, to analyze trends

as one of the most certain results so far, as expected, was to make cheaper shares- as President Trump was reported in Italian newspapers to have said- it is the time to get rich

next: the impact of tariff on China on the shopping cart of John Six Pack and some USA companies used to produce in "maquilladora" worldwide and then apply a kind of "Studio Accounting on steroids" to bring about a premium price for something produced cheaply elsewhere

pity that those portfolio data are for most part not public- but would be an interesting set of visualizations

This repository will contain documents, software components, analysis documents, etc related to the dataset above:
- extracted from public open data accessible via web (see "Production Notes" section at the end for details)
- overall aim: comparing company data pre- and post-COVID, i.e. evolution from 2019 to 2022 (balance sheet due July 2023)
